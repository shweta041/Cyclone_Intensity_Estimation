    <b>Key Features:</b>
    <br /><br />
    <b>Predictive Modeling:</b> Our machine learning model utilizes a combination of meteorological variables, such as sea surface temperature, wind speed, atmospheric pressure, and humidity, to forecast the intensity of cyclones. By analyzing historical
    data and training the model on past storm events, we can generate real-time predictions of cyclone intensity with confidence. <br /><br />
    <b>Interactive Visualization:</b> Users can explore interactive visualizations of cyclone intensity predictions, including maps, charts, and graphs, to gain insights into the spatial and temporal distribution of storm activity. These visualizations
    enable stakeholders to identify regions at risk and prioritize resource allocation for disaster preparedness and response.

    <br /><br />
    <b>Mission Statement:</b>
    <br /> Our mission is to harness the power of machine learning and data analytics to enhance our understanding of cyclones and improve our ability to forecast, prepare for, and respond to these devastating natural disasters. By combining cutting-edge
    technology with interdisciplinary expertise, we strive to empower communities, policymakers, and stakeholders with the knowledge and tools they need to build a more resilient future in the face of climate change and extreme weather events.

        <h2>Definition</h2>
        <p>
            A cyclone, in meteorological parlance, refers to a dynamic and formidable atmospheric phenomenon characterized by a swirling vortex of air with a markedly low-pressure center, typically accompanied by intense convective activity and formidable wind speeds.
            This meteorological entity arises from the intricate interplay of environmental factors such as warm oceanic temperatures, low vertical wind shear, and substantial atmospheric instability, culminating in the development of a distinctively
            organized system of thunderstorms and cloud formations. Cyclones manifest in diverse forms, including tropical cyclones arising in tropical regions and extratropical cyclones that emerge in mid-latitude zones, each exhibiting distinctive characteristics
            in terms of structure, behavior, and associated meteorological hazards.
